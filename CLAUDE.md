## Scope Discipline

**Do exactly what was asked — nothing adjacent.** Do not add README files, build scripts,
`.gitignore` edits, helper utilities, or extra tooling that was not requested. If an addition
looks valuable, **list it as a suggestion at the end** and let the user decide.

A request for a codebook is a request for a codebook. Delivering a codebook plus a README plus
build scripts plus gitignore edits means the user now has to review four things to accept one,
and the usual outcome is that all four get thrown away.

**Before adding anything not named in the request, ask.** One line is cheaper than a revert.

## Core Principles

- **Plan first** -- enter plan mode before non-trivial tasks; save plans to `quality_reports/plans/`
- **Verify after** -- when a task changes a `.tex`, `.qmd`, or `.R` file, compile or render it and confirm the output before reporting done
- **Single source of truth** -- Beamer `.tex` is authoritative; Quarto `.qmd` derives from it
- **Quality gates** -- nothing ships below 80/100
- **[LEARN] tags** -- when corrected, save `[LEARN:category] wrong → right` to [MEMORY.md](MEMORY.md)

Cross-session context lives in [MEMORY.md](MEMORY.md); past plans, specs, and session logs are in [quality_reports/](quality_reports/).

**How we verify** — the references and rules that carry the verification discipline:

- [`verification-ladder.md`](.claude/references/verification-ladder.md) — the seven rungs, from *qualify the checker* to the external oracle, and how the review loop converges.
- [`external-oracle-process.md`](.claude/references/external-oracle-process.md) — running an independent frontier-model referee (Claude Code → another vendor's model via the Oracle CLI; current targets in its §2) and adjudicating what it returns.
- [`provenance-and-ground-truth.md`](.claude/references/provenance-and-ground-truth.md) — naming and pinning your oracles, classifying divergence, and the clean-room boundary.
- [`review-fencing.md`](.claude/rules/review-fencing.md) — reviewer independence is a property of the environment, not an instruction: a neutral copy outside the checkout, prior verdicts withheld, and the answer keys the repo already commits fenced off.
- [`release-engineering.md`](.claude/references/release-engineering.md) — shipping research software: message and silent-resolution censuses, frozen feature matrices for ports, hash-claimed inherited tests, and downstream consumers pinned by commit SHA.

**How we write** — [`writing-with-ai.md`](.claude/rules/writing-with-ai.md): internal vs external-facing documents, why a model cannot make its own output stop reading as model output, and the human-readable standard for anything with your name on it.

**Theory work** — [`theory-proving.md`](.claude/references/theory-proving.md): proof contracts, portfolio search with isolated explorers, counterexample-hunting your own lemmas, adversarial audits, and the rule that an AI-generated proof is a claim, not a theorem.

**The laws** — [`research-agent-laws.md`](.claude/references/research-agent-laws.md): 21 laws for running agents on research infrastructure, each paid for by a real incident.

**How we remember** — the record lives in the repo, not the transcript:

- [`progress-reports.md`](.claude/rules/progress-reports.md) — GitHub issues as defect memory, `quality_reports/` as work memory, `MEMORY.md` as lesson memory.
- [`issue-ledger.md`](.claude/rules/issue-ledger.md) — every shipped bug, deferred improvement and blocking owner decision gets a GitHub issue, closed by hand when the fix lands; the evidence standard and the closing comment.
- [`repo-hygiene.md`](.claude/rules/repo-hygiene.md) — **scratch must not become main.** Enforced by `check-repo-hygiene.py` on every commit.

Nothing clears work until it has a row in [`quality_reports/qualification/LEDGER.md`](quality_reports/qualification/LEDGER.md) — run [`/vaccinate`](.claude/skills/vaccinate/SKILL.md) to put one there.

## Commands

```bash
# LaTeX (3-pass, XeLaTeX only)
cd Slides && TEXINPUTS=../Preambles:$TEXINPUTS xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode file.tex
BIBINPUTS=..:$BIBINPUTS bibtex file
TEXINPUTS=../Preambles:$TEXINPUTS xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode file.tex
TEXINPUTS=../Preambles:$TEXINPUTS xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode file.tex

# Deploy Quarto to GitHub Pages
./scripts/sync_to_docs.sh LectureN

# Quality score
python3 scripts/quality_score.py Quarto/file.qmd

# Palette sync (LaTeX ↔ SCSS)
./scripts/check-palette-sync.sh

# Backtest: is the repo internally consistent and currently true?
# (surface-sync + skill-integrity + model-versions + links + spec-conformance + staleness + repo-hygiene + derived-counts + ledger-coverage + hook-battery + portability)
# Run this after ANY change. Also runs in pre-commit and CI.
./scripts/backtest.sh
```

**Palette contract:** color names in `Preambles/header.tex` must match SCSS variables in `Quarto/theme-template.scss`. See [`Preambles/README.md`](Preambles/README.md).

## Quality Thresholds (advisory)

| Score | Checkpoint | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| 80 | Commit | Good enough to save |
| 90 | PR | Ready for deployment |
| 95 | Excellence | Aspirational |

Enforced by `/commit` (halts + asks for override) **and** — once you run `./scripts/install-hooks.sh` — by a real git pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`) that runs the backtest gate suite (the hook battery only when a hook, its settings or the battery itself is staged; CI always runs everything) plus the quality (≥80) gate on every commit. Bypass sparingly with `SKIP_QUALITY_GATE=1` or `--no-verify`.
