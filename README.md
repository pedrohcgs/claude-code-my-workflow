# My Claude Code Setup

> **Work in progress.** This is not meant to be a polished guide for everyone. It's mostly a summary of how I've been using Claude Code for academic work — slides, papers, data analysis, and more. I keep learning new things, and as I do, I keep updating these files. This is just a way for me to share what I've figured out with friends and colleagues.

**Live site:** [psantanna.com/claude-code-my-workflow](https://psantanna.com/claude-code-my-workflow/)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-27

A ready-to-fork foundation for AI-assisted academic work. You describe what you want — lecture slides, a research paper, a data analysis, a replication package — and Claude plans the approach, runs specialized agents, fixes issues, verifies quality, and presents results. Like a contractor who handles the entire job. Extracted from a production PhD course and extended by a growing [community](#community--extensions).

---

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
# Fork this repo on GitHub (click "Fork" on the repo page), then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/claude-code-my-workflow.git my-project
cd my-project
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

### 2. Start Claude Code and Paste This Prompt

```bash
claude
```

**Using VS Code?** Open the Claude Code panel instead. Everything works the same — see the [full guide](https://psantanna.com/claude-code-my-workflow/workflow-guide.html#sec-setup) for details.

Then paste the [starter prompt](https://psantanna.com/claude-code-my-workflow/workflow-guide.html#sec-first-session) from the guide, filling in your project details:

> I am starting to work on **[PROJECT NAME]** in this repo. **[Describe your project in 2–3 sentences.]** I've set up the Claude Code academic workflow... Please read the configuration files and adapt them for my project. Enter plan mode and start.

The [full guide](https://psantanna.com/claude-code-my-workflow/workflow-guide.html#sec-first-session) has the complete starter prompt with all the details.

**What this does:** Claude reads all the configuration files, fills in your project name, institution, and preferences, then enters contractor mode — planning, implementing, reviewing, and verifying autonomously. You approve the plan and Claude handles the rest.

---

## How It Works

### Contractor Mode

You describe a task. For complex or ambiguous requests, Claude first creates a requirements specification with MUST/SHOULD/MAY priorities and clarity status (CLEAR/ASSUMED/BLOCKED). You approve the spec, then Claude plans the approach, implements it, runs specialized review agents, fixes issues, re-verifies, and scores against quality gates — all autonomously. You see a summary when the work meets quality standards. Say "just do it" and it auto-commits too.

### Specialized Agents

Instead of one general-purpose reviewer, 10 focused agents each check one dimension:

- **proofreader** — grammar/typos
- **slide-auditor** — visual layout
- **pedagogy-reviewer** — teaching quality
- **r-reviewer** — R code quality
- **domain-reviewer** — field-specific correctness (template — customize for your field)

Each is better at its narrow task than a generalist would be. The `/slide-excellence` skill runs them all in parallel. The same pattern extends to any academic artifact — manuscripts, data pipelines, proposals.

### Adversarial QA

Two agents work in opposition: the **critic** reads both Beamer and Quarto and produces harsh findings. The **fixer** implements exactly what the critic found. They loop until the critic says "APPROVED" (or 5 rounds max). This catches errors that single-pass review misses.

### Quality Gates

Every file gets a score (0–100). Scores below threshold block the action:
- **80** — commit threshold
- **90** — PR threshold
- **95** — excellence (aspirational)

### Context Survival

Plans, specifications, and session logs survive auto-compression and session boundaries. The PreCompact hook saves a context snapshot before Claude's auto-compression triggers, ensuring critical decisions are never lost. MEMORY.md accumulates learning across sessions, so patterns discovered in one session inform future work.

### Rules (`.claude/rules/`)

Rules use path-scoped loading: **always-on** rules load every session (~100 lines total); **path-scoped** rules load only when Claude works on matching files. Claude follows ~150 instructions reliably, so less is more.

**Always-on** (no `paths:` frontmatter — load every session):

| Rule | What It Enforces |
|------|-----------------|
| `plan-first-workflow` | Plan mode for non-trivial tasks + context preservation |
| `orchestrator-protocol` | Contractor mode: implement → verify → review → fix → score |
| `session-logging` | Three logging triggers: post-plan, incremental, end-of-session |
| `meta-governance` | Template vs. working project distinctions |

**Path-scoped** (load only when working on matching files):

| Rule | Triggers On | What It Enforces |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| `verification-protocol` | `.tex`, `.qmd`, `docs/` | Task completion checklist |
| `single-source-of-truth` | `Figures/`, `.tex`, `.qmd` | No content duplication; Beamer is authoritative |
| `quality-gates` | `.tex`, `.qmd`, `*.R` | 80/90/95 scoring + tolerance thresholds |
| `r-code-conventions` | `*.R` | R coding standards + math line-length exception |

## Origin

This infrastructure was extracted from **Econ 730: Causal Panel Data** at Emory University, developed by Pedro Sant'Anna using Claude Code over 6+ sessions. The course produced 6 complete PhD lecture decks with 800+ slides, interactive Quarto versions with plotly charts, and full R replication packages — all managed through this multi-agent workflow. The patterns are domain-agnostic: the same agents, rules, and orchestrator work for any academic project.
