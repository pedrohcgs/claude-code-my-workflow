title: "The Clo-Author"
subtitle: "Your Econ AI Research Assistant for Claude Code"
---

An open-source [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) workflow that turns your terminal into a full-service applied econometrics research assistant --- from literature review to journal submission.

**Built on** [Pedro Sant'Anna's claude-code-my-workflow](https://github.com/pedrohcgs/claude-code-my-workflow), reoriented for applied econometrics research publication.

## What You Get

| Component | Count | Examples |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Specialized agents | 15 | Econometrician, Writer, Coder, Referee, Strategist |
| Slash commands | 29 | `/econometrics-check`, `/paper-excellence`, `/new-project` |
| Auto-loading rules | 21 | Quality gates, scoring protocol, adversarial pairing |
| Hooks | 7 | Session log reminder, context survival, file protection |

You describe a task in plain English. Claude plans the approach, implements it, runs specialized review agents, fixes issues, verifies quality, and presents results. Like a contractor who manages the entire job.

## Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Fork & Clone

```bash
gh repo fork hsantanna88/clo-author --clone
cd clo-author
```

### Step 2: Start Claude Code

```bash
claude
```

Using VS Code? Open the Claude Code panel instead. Everything works the same.

### Step 3: Paste the Starter Prompt

Fill in the **bolded placeholders** with your project details:

> I am starting a new applied econometrics research project on **[YOUR TOPIC]**.
> Read CLAUDE.md and help me set up the project structure.
> Start with a literature review on [YOUR TOPIC].

Claude reads the configuration, fills in your project details, and enters contractor mode --- planning, implementing, reviewing, and verifying autonomously.

### Step 4: Start Working

Once setup is done, just describe what you need:

- "Review my paper and check the econometrics" --- runs `/paper-excellence` with parallel agents
- `/econometrics-check Paper/main.tex` --- 4-phase causal inference audit
- `/data-analysis Data/cleaned/survey.csv` --- end-to-end analysis with publication-ready output
- `/new-project health insurance` --- full pipeline from idea to paper

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

You talk, Claude orchestrates. The 15 agents work in **worker-critic pairs** --- every creator has a paired critic who can't edit files, only review. The orchestrator dispatches agents based on a dependency graph, enforces quality gates (80/90/95), and routes escalations when critics and creators can't agree after 3 rounds.

For the full picture, see the [User Guide](user-guide.qmd) (what you can do) and [Architecture Reference](architecture.qmd) (how the system works).

## Day 1 Checklist

- [ ] Fork the repo and clone it locally
- [ ] Run `claude` in the project directory
- [ ] Paste the starter prompt (fill in your project details)
- [ ] Wait for Claude to customize `CLAUDE.md` for your project
- [ ] Approve the configuration plan
- [ ] Ask Claude to do something: "Review my paper" or "/lit-review [topic]"
- [ ] Approve the task plan, watch it work, review the output

That's it. Everything else --- agents, hooks, rules --- runs automatically in the background.

## Optional: Manual Setup

If you prefer to configure things yourself instead of letting Claude handle it:

**Customize CLAUDE.md** --- Open `CLAUDE.md` and replace all `[BRACKETED PLACEHOLDERS]`:

1. **Project name and institution**
2. **Folder structure** (adjust to your layout)
3. **Current project state** (your papers and analyses)

**Fill in the domain profile** --- Run `/interview-me` or manually edit `.claude/rules/domain-profile.md`:

1. **Your field** and adjacent subfields
2. **Target journals** ranked by tier
3. **Common data sources** and identification strategies
4. **Field conventions** and seminal references

**Configure permissions** --- Review `.claude/settings.json`. The template includes permissions for git, LaTeX, R, and utility scripts.

**Test it:**

```bash
/compile-latex main
/proofread Paper/main.tex
```

## Origin

This project is a fork of [Pedro Sant'Anna's claude-code-my-workflow](https://github.com/pedrohcgs/claude-code-my-workflow), which was built for Econ 730 at Emory University (6 lectures, 800+ slides). The Clo-Author reorients that infrastructure from lecture production to applied econometrics research publication.
