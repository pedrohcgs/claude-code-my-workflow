# Quality Review & Scoring Rubrics

> **Framing:** Thresholds are **advisory at the harness level**. The `/commit` skill runs `quality_score.py` and halts on failure until the user fixes or explicitly overrides. There is no git pre-commit hook that blocks a direct `git commit` — if you bypass the skill, you bypass the review. "Gate" in this file means "checkpoint enforced by a specific skill," not "repo-wide block."

## Thresholds

- **80/100 = Commit** -- good enough to save
- **90/100 = PR** -- ready for deployment
- **95/100 = Excellence** -- aspirational

## Quarto Slides (.qmd)

| Severity | Issue | Deduction |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Critical | Compilation failure | -100 |
| Critical | Equation overflow | -20 |
| Critical | Broken citation | -15 |
| Critical | Typo in equation | -10 |
| Major | Text overflow | -5 |
| Major | TikZ label overlap | -5 |
| Major | Notation inconsistency | -3 |
| Minor | Font size reduction | -1 per slide |
| Minor | Long lines (>100 chars) | -1 (EXCEPT documented math formulas) |

## R Scripts (.R)

| Severity | Issue | Deduction |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Critical | Syntax errors | -100 |
| Critical | Domain-specific bugs | -30 |
| Critical | Hardcoded absolute paths | -20 |
| Major | Missing set.seed() | -10 |
| Major | Missing figure generation | -5 |

## Beamer Slides (.tex)

| Severity | Issue | Deduction |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Critical | XeLaTeX compilation failure | -100 |
| Critical | Undefined citation | -15 |
| Critical | Overfull hbox > 10pt | -10 |

## Enforcement (by the /commit skill only)

- **Score < 80:** Halt within `/commit`. List blocking issues. User may override with an explicit natural-language signal ("commit anyway" / "skip quality gate") and a reason — the override is logged in the commit body.
- **Score < 90:** Allow commit within `/commit`, warn. List recommendations.
- **Direct `git commit`** (bypassing the skill): no enforcement. For hard enforcement, install a git pre-commit hook that wraps `quality_score.py`.

## Quality Reports

Generated **only at merge time**. Use `templates/quality-report.md` for format.
Save to `quality_reports/merges/YYYY-MM-DD_[branch-name].md`.

## Tolerance Thresholds (Research)

| Quantity | Tolerance | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Point estimates | ≤ 1e-6 | Numerical precision (deterministic code, no MC) |
| Standard errors | ≤ 1e-4 | Bootstrap / clustering run-to-run variation |
| Coverage rates | ± 0.01 | MC simulation with reasonable B reps |
| Counts / N | Exact | No acceptable difference |
