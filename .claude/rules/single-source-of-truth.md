# Single Source of Truth: Paper-Centric Protocol

**The paper `Paper/main.tex` is the authoritative source for ALL research content.** Everything else is derived.

## The SSOT Chain

```
Paper/main.tex (SOURCE OF TRUTH)
  ├── Talks/*.tex (derived — seminar, job market, short, lightning)
  ├── Supplementary/*.tex (derived — online appendix)
  ├── Figures/ (generated by R scripts, referenced by paper)
  ├── Tables/ (generated by R scripts, referenced by paper)
  ├── Bibliography_base.bib (shared)
  └── Replication/ (deposit package, assembled from scripts + data)

NEVER edit derived artifacts independently.
ALWAYS propagate changes from paper → talks.
```

## Talk Derivation Protocol

Talks are **derived from the paper**, not independently authored:

1. When paper content changes, flag affected talks for update
2. Each talk format has different coverage:
   - Job market (40-50 slides): full results, mechanism, robustness highlights
   - Seminar (25-35 slides): main result, 1-2 robustness checks
   - Short (10-15 slides): key result + implication
   - Lightning (3-5 slides): hook, result, so-what
3. Figures/tables in talks MUST match paper versions exactly
4. Notation in talks MUST match paper notation

## Figure and Table Freshness

**Before referencing any figure or table in a talk, verify it matches the paper version.**

1. Check that R script output is current (compare file timestamps)
2. Verify figure/table numbering matches paper
3. If paper has been revised since talk was last updated, flag for re-derivation

## Content Fidelity Checklist (Paper → Talk)

```
[ ] All results in talk appear in paper (no talk-only results)
[ ] Effect sizes match exactly
[ ] Standard errors / confidence intervals match
[ ] Notation is consistent (same subscripts, same variable names)
[ ] Citations in talk are a subset of paper citations
[ ] Figures are identical (same R script output, not redrawn)
```
