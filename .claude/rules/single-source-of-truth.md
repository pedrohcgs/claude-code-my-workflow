# Single Source of Truth: Enforcement Protocol

**The Beamer `.tex` file is the authoritative source for ALL content.** Everything else is derived.

---

## TikZ Freshness Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Before using ANY TikZ SVG in a Quarto slide, verify it matches the current Beamer source.**

### The Diff-Check Procedure

```
Step 1: Read the TikZ block from the Beamer .tex file
Step 2: Read the corresponding block from Figures/LectureN/extract_tikz.tex
Step 3: Compare EVERY coordinate, label, color, opacity, and anchor point
Step 4: If ANY difference exists → update extract_tikz.tex from Beamer → recompile → regenerate SVGs
Step 5: Only then reference the SVG in the QMD
```

### When to Re-Extract

Re-extract ALL TikZ diagrams when:
- The Beamer `.tex` file has been modified since the last extraction
- Starting a new Quarto translation
- Any TikZ-related quality issue is reported
- Before any commit that includes QMD changes

---

## Environment Parity Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Every Beamer environment MUST have a CSS equivalent before translation begins.**

Before translating ANY lecture to Quarto:

1. **Scan the Beamer source** for all custom environments
2. **Check each against your theme SCSS file**
3. **If ANY environment is missing from SCSS → create it BEFORE translating**

---

## Content Fidelity Mandate

**Quarto translation must be FAITHFUL to Beamer content, not a paraphrase.**

### What "Faithful" Means
- Every Beamer frame → one Quarto slide (1:1 mapping)
- Every mathematical expression → identical notation
- Every citation → same reference
- Every figure → same data visualization
- Every environment → CSS equivalent

### Content Fidelity Checklist
```
[ ] Frame count: Beamer frames == Quarto slides
[ ] Math check: every equation appears with identical notation
[ ] Citation check: every \cite has a @key in Quarto
[ ] Environment check: every Beamer box has CSS equivalent
[ ] Figure check: every \includegraphics has SVG or plotly equivalent
[ ] No added content: Quarto does not invent slides not in Beamer
[ ] No dropped content: every Beamer idea appears in Quarto
```

## The Single Source of Truth Chain

```
Beamer .tex (SOURCE OF TRUTH)
  ├── extract_tikz.tex → PDF → SVGs (derived)
  ├── Quarto .qmd → HTML (derived)
  ├── Bibliography_base.bib (shared)
  └── Figures/LectureN/*.rds → plotly charts (data source)

NEVER edit derived artifacts independently.
ALWAYS propagate changes from source → derived.
```
