# Replication-First Protocol

**Core principle:** Replicate original results to the dot BEFORE extending.

---

## Phase 1: Inventory & Baseline

Before writing any R code:

- [ ] Read the paper's replication README
- [ ] Inventory replication package: language, data files, scripts, outputs
- [ ] Record gold standard numbers from the paper:

```markdown
## Replication Targets: [Paper Author (Year)]

| Target | Table/Figure | Value | SE/CI | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Main ATT | Table 2, Col 3 | -1.632 | (0.584) | Primary specification |
```

- [ ] Store targets in `quality_reports/LectureNN_replication_targets.md` or as RDS

---

## Phase 2: Translate & Execute

- [ ] Follow `r-code-conventions.md` for all R coding standards
- [ ] Translate line-by-line initially -- don't "improve" during replication
- [ ] Match original specification exactly (covariates, sample, clustering, SE computation)
- [ ] Save all intermediate results as RDS

### Stata to R Translation Pitfalls

<!-- Customize: Add pitfalls specific to your field -->

| Stata | R | Trap |
|-------|---|------|
| `reg y x, cluster(id)` | `feols(y ~ x, cluster = ~id)` | Stata clusters df-adjust differently from some R packages |
| `areg y x, absorb(id)` | `feols(y ~ x \| id)` | Check demeaning method matches |
| `probit` for PS | `glm(family=binomial(link="probit"))` | R default logit != Stata default in some commands |
| `bootstrap, reps(999)` | Depends on method | Match seed, reps, and bootstrap type exactly |

---

## Phase 3: Verify Match

### Tolerance Thresholds

| Type | Tolerance | Rationale |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Integers (N, counts) | Exact match | No reason for any difference |
| Point estimates | < 0.01 | Rounding in paper display |
| Standard errors | < 0.05 | Bootstrap/clustering variation |
| P-values | Same significance level | Exact p may differ slightly |
| Percentages | < 0.1pp | Display rounding |

### If Mismatch

**Do NOT proceed to extensions.** Isolate which step introduces the difference, check common causes (sample size, SE computation, default options, variable definitions), and document the investigation even if unresolved.

### Replication Report

Save to `quality_reports/LectureNN_replication_report.md`:

```markdown
# Replication Report: [Paper Author (Year)]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Original language:** [Stata/R/etc.]
**R translation:** [script path]

## Summary
- **Targets checked / Passed / Failed:** N / M / K
- **Overall:** [REPLICATED / PARTIAL / FAILED]

## Results Comparison

| Target | Paper | Ours | Diff | Status |
|--------|-------|------|------|--------|

## Discrepancies (if any)
- **Target:** X | **Investigation:** ... | **Resolution:** ...

## Environment
- R version, key packages (with versions), data source
```

---

## Phase 4: Only Then Extend

After replication is verified (all targets PASS):

- [ ] Commit replication script: "Replicate [Paper] Table X -- all targets match"
- [ ] Now extend with new estimators, additional robustness, novel analyses
- [ ] Each extension builds on the verified baseline

---

## Phase 5: AEA Data Deposit Preparation

After all analyses are complete and paper is ready for submission:

### 5.1 Package Assembly
- [ ] All scripts numbered sequentially (01_, 02_, ...)
- [ ] Master script present and tested end-to-end
- [ ] README in AEA Data Editor format (use `/data-deposit` skill)
- [ ] No hardcoded absolute paths anywhere
- [ ] No API keys or credentials in scripts
- [ ] sessionInfo() or package versions documented

### 5.2 Audit
- [ ] Run `/audit-replication` skill
- [ ] All 6 audit checks PASS
- [ ] Runtime documented (time a fresh R session run)

### 5.3 Deposit
- [ ] openICPSR deposit: upload package, set DOI
- [ ] Update paper with Data Availability Statement
- [ ] Add data citation to `Bibliography_base.bib`

### Audit Tolerance Thresholds

| Item | Standard |
|------|----------|
| Table values | Exact match (same R version) |
| Figure appearance | Visual match + same underlying data |
| Runtime estimate | Within 2x of documented time |
| Package version mismatch | Warning (not failure) |
