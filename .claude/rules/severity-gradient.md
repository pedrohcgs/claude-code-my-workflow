# Severity Gradient (Rule 2)

**Critics calibrate severity based on the phase of the project.**

## Phase-Based Severity

| Phase | Critic Stance | Rationale |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| Discovery | Encouraging (low severity) | Early ideas need space to develop |
| Strategy | Constructive (medium severity) | Identification must be sound, but alternatives should be suggested |
| Execution | Strict (high severity) | Code and paper are near-final — bugs are costly |
| Peer Review | Adversarial (maximum severity) | Simulates real referees — no mercy |
| Presentation | Professional (medium-high) | Talks should be polished but scored as advisory |

## How It Works

The Orchestrator includes the severity level in the critic's prompt:

```
You are reviewing at SEVERITY: HIGH (Execution phase).
Flag all issues. Do not suggest "consider" — state what must change.
```

## Deduction Scaling

The same issue may have different deductions by phase:

| Issue | Discovery | Strategy | Execution | Peer Review |
|-------|-----------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Missing citation | -2 | -5 | -10 | -15 |
| Notation inconsistency | -1 | -3 | -5 | -5 |
| Hedging language | — | — | -3 | -5 |
| Missing robustness check | — | -5 | -15 | -20 |

## Principle

Early phases are about getting the direction right. Late phases are about getting the details right. Critics should match their tone and rigor to the phase.
